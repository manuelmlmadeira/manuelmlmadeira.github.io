<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Welcome, I am Manuel!

I am a PhD student at [LTS4](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/), at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), under the supervision of [Pascal Frossard](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/people/people-current/frossard/) and [Dorina Thanou](https://people.epfl.ch/dorina.thanou?lang=en). I am broadly interested in enabling scientific discoveries using AI methods. Currently, I am working on Graph Neural Networks for biomedical data, mainly in the generative setting.

Apart from Academia, I am also a proud co-organizer of [Deep Learning Sessions Portugal](https://deeplearningpt.github.io). We are a volunteer group whose goal is to promote the collaboration among Deep Learning practitioners and the AI literacy in Portugal.

Before starting my PhD, I was a Machine Learning researcher at [Inductiva Research Labs](https://inductiva.ai), where I worked on Physics-Informed Neural Networks for heat diffusion and coastal dynamics.

Prior to that, I got a BSc and a MSc in Biomedical Engineering from [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). I was also a visiting student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
For my MSc thesis, I worked on variance reduction for Stochastic Convex Optimization with [Renato Negrinho](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~negrinho/), [Pedro Aguiar](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~aguiar/), and [João Xavier](http://users.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~jxavier/).

In my spare time, I am really into sports! Back in Portugal, I used to play football at a decent level. You can check my (Portuguese) football player page [here](https://www.zerozero.pt/player.php?id=473202&epoca_id=151) and a young Manuel playing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuynV0rC6Uw) (8 in red and black stripes).
I do also enjoy great [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110959921-manuel-madeira) and [movies](https://letterboxd.com/manuel_madeira/)!
